# ML.NET-Jupyter-Notebooks

A collection of C# Jupyter notebooks covering some ML.NET scenarios inspired by https://github.com/XamlBrewer/UWP-MachineLearning-Sample.

It is best viewed via [nbViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/XamlBrewer/ML.NET-Jupyter-Notebooks/tree/master/notebooks/).

It is a **work in progress**, but sofar we can offer the following samples:

* Building and Visualizing Models:
  * Clustering
  * Binary Classification
  * Multiclass Classification
  * Regression
  * Recommendation using Matrix Factorization
  * Recommendation using Field-Aware Factorization Machine

* Data Analysis:
  * Distribution analysis using Box Plots
  * Correlation analysis using Heatmaps

Here's a screenshot of one of these:
