# ML.NET-Jupyter-Notebooks

A collection of C# Jupyter Notebooks covering some ML.NET scenarios inspired by https://github.com/XamlBrewer/UWP-MachineLearning-Sample.

It is a **work in progress**, but sofar we can offer the following samples:

* Building and Visualizing Models:
  * Clustering
  * Binary Classification
  * Multiclass Classification
  * Recommendation using Matrix Factorization
  * Recommendation using Field-Aware Factorization Machine
